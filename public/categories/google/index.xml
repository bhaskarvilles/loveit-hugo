&lt;p>Google is launching a cloud-based node engine service for Ethereum developers and projects, the tech company announced Thursday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officially called Blockchain Node Engine, Google’s offering is a “fully managed service,” meaning customers won’t have to hire their own teams to maintain or monitor their nodes. Instead, Google says it “actively monitors the nodes and restarts them if anything goes wrong.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Blockchain Node Engine also includes various security features like Google’s Cloud Armor, which is designed to prevent denial-of-service (DDos) attacks that spam and slow down networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google's new password less authentication technology</title><link>https://secretcoder.org/2022/10/googles-new-password-less-authentication-technology/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://secretcoder.org/2022/10/googles-new-password-less-authentication-technology/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="google-rolling-out-passkey-passwordless-login-support-to-android-and-chrome">Google Rolling Out Passkey Passwordless Login Support to Android and Chrome&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Google on Wednesday officially rolled out support for passkeys, the next-generation authentication standard, to both Android and Chrome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Passkeys are a significantly safer replacement for passwords and other phishable authentication factors,&amp;rdquo; the tech giant said. &amp;ldquo;They cannot be reused, don&amp;rsquo;t leak in server breaches, and protect users from phishing attacks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To that end, creating a passkey requires confirmation from the end-user about the account that will be used to log in to the online service, followed by using their biometric information or the device passcode.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p>Google is launching a cloud-based node engine service for Ethereum developers and projects, the tech company announced Thursday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officially called Blockchain Node Engine, Google’s offering is a “fully managed service,” meaning customers won’t have to hire their own teams to maintain or monitor their nodes. Instead, Google says it “actively monitors the nodes and restarts them if anything goes wrong.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Blockchain Node Engine also includes various security features like Google’s Cloud Armor, which is designed to prevent denial-of-service (DDos) attacks that spam and slow down networks.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

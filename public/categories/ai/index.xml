      <description>My thoughts on EVMs Multi Client repository One important aspect of Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s security and decentralization is its multi-client philosophy. Instead of relying on a single reference client, Ethereum has a specification written in Python and multiple independent implementations of the spec called clients. Each node runs a consensus client to validate blocks and an execution client to check state transitions. Currently, no single client makes up more than two-thirds of either category.</description>

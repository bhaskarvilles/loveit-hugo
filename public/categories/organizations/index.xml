&lt;p>The FVM enables developers to build many new use cases on top of and with the Filecoin network.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="data-access-control">Data access control&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One advantage centralized storage solutions have over web3 services is that they can limit individual data access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The FVM enables Filecoin network participants to do the same. Threshold encryption networks, like Medusa, can individually or programmatically govern who can access a data collection without any contracts or validators having access to the data themselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DAOs and the Future of Decentralization - Insights from Bhaskar Developer, ETHGlobal Fellow, and Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum</title><link>https://secretcoder.org/2022/12/daos-and-the-future-of-decentralization-insights-from-bhaskar-developer-ethglobal-fellow-and-vitalik-buterin-the-founder-of-ethereum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://secretcoder.org/2022/12/daos-and-the-future-of-decentralization-insights-from-bhaskar-developer-ethglobal-fellow-and-vitalik-buterin-the-founder-of-ethereum/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="daos-and-the-future-of-decentralization---insights-from-bhaskar---developer-ethglobal-fellow-and-vitalik-buterin-the-founder-of-ethereum">DAOs and the Future of Decentralization - Insights from Bhaskar - Developer, ETHGlobal Fellow, and Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are digital entities that operate on blockchain technology, and they have been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. Unlike traditional corporations, DAOs are decentralized, meaning that they operate on a consensus-based system where all members have an equal say in decision-making. This is where the term &amp;ldquo;autonomous&amp;rdquo; comes in, as DAOs are able to operate independently without the need for intermediaries.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
